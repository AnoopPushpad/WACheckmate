## How to Use it ? (Usage)

Follow the steps below to use this tool:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your Windows system. If not, you can download and install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Additionally, I have already included the Windows chromedriver with the repository. However, if you are not using Windows, you can download the appropriate chromedriver from [here](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) for your system.

2. After installing Python and the setting up the chromedriver, you need to input the numbers within the `numbers.txt` file along with the country code. For example, `+912903372794`, where `+91` is the country code.

3. Once you have input the numbers, run the `main.py` script, and follow the instructions provided.

4. Once the checking is complete, the results will be saved in a CSV file within the folder.
